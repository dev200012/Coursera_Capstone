Additionally, the outcomes of this analysis can be used as a prescriptive tool to :\n",

    "By being able to allocate medical emergency resources more efficiently and by being able to reduce injuries and deaths through prevention campaigns, society as a whole will reduce the economic impact of road hazards. This analysis is therefore aimed at decision-makers of the Swiss Confederation, notably those in charge of Transportation and Medical Affairs. Beyond economic considerations, there is also a moral value in reducing the suffering and deaths of the thousands of people affected by road accidents.\n"
