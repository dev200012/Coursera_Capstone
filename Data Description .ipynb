    "The dataset used here is defined as \"Road accidents where at least one of the parties was injured or worse\". As a result, this dataset does not report on material damages or other consequences than bodily injuries. It is also worth noting that this dataset does not distinguish between what exact type of vehicle was involved, whether a car, bicycle, motorcycle, tractor, pedestrian, skater, etc. The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from the website of the Swiss Federal Statistics Office (OFS). A data browser allows the user to select the dimensions and time range of interest, within the limits of the Office's data structure. The used time range is the calendar year 2019. No other data source was used."
